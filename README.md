OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

Key Features

Arithmetic Functions:

The calculator defines four functions:

Addition (add): Takes two numbers and returns their sum.

Subtraction (subtract): Takes two numbers and returns the difference.

Multiplication (multiply): Takes two numbers and returns their product.

Division (divide): Takes two numbers and returns the quotient. It includes a check to prevent division by zero.

User Interaction:

The program runs in a loop, continuously prompting the user for input until they decide to exit.

Users can choose an operation by entering a specific symbol:

+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division
Users can type exit to terminate the program.

Input Handling:

After selecting an operation, the user is prompted to enter two numbers.
The program then calls the appropriate function based on the user's choice and displays the result.
If the user enters an invalid option, they are prompted to try again.

Example Workflow

The user starts the program.
They see a list of options and choose an operation (e.g., +).
They input two numbers (e.g., 5 and 3).
The program calculates the result (e.g., 5 + 3 = 8) and displays it.
The user can continue performing calculations or type exit to end the program.

Conclusion

This basic calculator project is an excellent starting point for beginners in Python programming. It demonstrates fundamental concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and user input handling in a straightforward and interactive way.
